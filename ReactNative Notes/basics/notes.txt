React Native:
------------------------
What is hook?
Ans:A hook is a function that add some new functionalities to the functional component
in react native.

const [counter,setCounter]=useState(0);
Array destucturing
const colors=['red','green'];
color[0];
ans:"red"
color[1];
ans:"green"

const [colorOne,colorTwo]=["red","green"];


What is State:
we don't modify state variable directly.
we modify state variable using set method only
State is containing data passing inside component itself only

What is Props:
props is a object we send data from parent to child component using props

TemplateString with interpulation:
`${var} hello ${var2}`

ES6 Arrays
setColors([...colors,randomRgb()])
store result array

Reducers
Reducer is a function that manages to changes the object
that managing changes to the object

in reducer action means change the value like change default
value for suppose the a value is 1 i want to change a=1 to
a=2 by using action ,it refers to which one you need to change

but payload means how much you want to modify means value to modify

here state means current object 
we want to modify state object we must and should rebuild the 
state object from scratch

dispatch means run my reducer

action having two type of properties
